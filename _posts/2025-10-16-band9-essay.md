#  How to Write a Band 9 IELTS Essay ‚Äî Technical Style Guide

##  Overview
Band 9 writing is not just about vocabulary ‚Äî it‚Äôs about **technical precision**, **logical design**, and **academic tone**.  
This guide explains how to think, write, and structure your essay like a professional analyst, not a student.

##  1Ô∏è‚É£ Think Like an Examiner

| Criterion | Technical Question to Ask Yourself |
|------------|------------------------------------|
| **Task Response** | Have I answered *every part* of the question with a clear stance? |
| **Coherence & Cohesion** | Do my ideas connect logically ‚Äî cause ‚Üí effect ‚Üí implication? |
| **Lexical Resource** | Can I replace common words with precise, academic alternatives? |
| **Grammatical Range & Accuracy** | Is my structure complex but still natural and clear? |

üí° *Goal:* You are not ‚Äúwriting an essay‚Äù ‚Äî you are **demonstrating linguistic control** and academic reasoning.

##  2Ô∏è‚É£ Core Features of Band 9 Technical Style

| Feature | Function | Example |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Nominalisation** | Turns verbs/adjectives into nouns for density | *Diplomats negotiated ‚Üí The **negotiation** between diplomats* |
| **Passive or Impersonal Voice** | Keeps tone formal and objective | *It is widely believed that...* |
| **Embedded Clauses** | Adds information precisely | *Sanctions, **which are often broad in scope**, may harm civilians.* |
| **Complex Sentence Variety** | Blends subordination and emphasis | *Were diplomacy more transparent, trust might grow.* |
| **Thematic Progression** | Ends each sentence with an idea picked up by the next | *This trust fosters cooperation. Cooperation, in turn, sustains peace.* |
| **Abstract Lexis** | Replaces emotional with conceptual language | *peace ‚Üí stability / deterrence / reconciliation* |
| **Cohesive Precision** | Logical connectors used sparingly | *Nevertheless, Consequently, By contrast, Ultimately* |

##  3Ô∏è‚É£ Syntax Engineering Tools

| Device | Purpose | Example |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Inversion** | Adds emphasis and formality | *Rarely has diplomacy been so crucial to stability.* |
| **Cleft Sentence** | Focuses on contrast or key element | *It is not coercion but communication that achieves peace.* |
| **Parallelism** | Creates rhythm and balance | *morally defensible and strategically sustainable.* |
| **Participial Reduction** | Compresses clauses elegantly | *Having signed the treaty, both sides withdrew troops.* |
| **Nominal Chain** | Packs abstract meaning | *the implementation of verification mechanisms.* |

---

##  4Ô∏è‚É£ Sentence-Level Technical Design

Every Band 9 sentence contains three elements:

1. **Abstract subject** (concept, not person)  
2. **Process verb** (academic action word)  
3. **Result or qualifier**

**Example:**
> *Diplomacy **facilitates reciprocal concessions**, thereby **enhancing regional stability.***

üí¨ Each component carries analytical weight ‚Äî no filler words.

---

##  5Ô∏è‚É£ Paragraph Structure ‚Äî The C.E.E.R. Model

> **C ‚Äì Claim** ‚Üí **E ‚Äì Explanation** ‚Üí **E ‚Äì Evidence** ‚Üí **R ‚Äì Result**

**Example:**
1. *Claim:* Sanctions can restrain aggression.  
2. *Explanation:* They restrict access to critical resources.  
3. *Evidence:* For example, Iran‚Äôs oil exports dropped by 40%.  
4. *Result:* Consequently, negotiations resumed within months.

üí° Each sentence drives logic forward ‚Äî never repeats or circles back.

##  6Ô∏è‚É£ Lexical Precision Upgrades

| Common Word | Technical Equivalent |
|--------------|----------------------|
| make better | **enhance / optimise / strengthen** |
| make worse | **exacerbate / undermine / erode** |
| say / show | **indicate / illustrate / demonstrate** |
| problem | **challenge / constraint / obstacle** |
| people | **stakeholders / actors / citizens / participants** |
| good | **beneficial / advantageous / constructive** |
| bad | **detrimental / adverse / undesirable** |
