We all know that heat naturally moves from **hot to cold** ‚Äî that‚Äôs just physics.  
But what if we need to do the opposite?  
To take heat from a **cool room** and throw it outside into the **hot air**?

That‚Äôs where **air-conditioning** steps in.  
Specifically, it‚Äôs where a process called the **vapour-compression refrigeration cycle** comes to life.

## üå¨Ô∏è The Science of Moving Heat

In simple terms, **air-conditioning systems are heat movers**.  
They transfer heat from indoor spaces to the outdoor environment using a circulating fluid called a **refrigerant**.

This refrigerant absorbs heat at low temperatures and releases it at high temperatures ‚Äî all inside a closed, repeating cycle.  

The machines that make this happen are called **chillers** or **air-conditioning units**, and they belong to the broader system known as **Air-Conditioning and Mechanical Ventilation (ACMV)**.

## ‚öóÔ∏è The Role of Refrigerants

The **refrigerant** is the **lifeblood** of the system.  
It‚Äôs what carries the heat around the loop.

In Singapore and most modern systems, the common refrigerants are **R123** and **R134a**.

| Refrigerant | Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP) | Global Warming Potential (GWP) |
|--------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| R123 | 0.02 | 77 |
| R134a | 0 | 1430 |

According to the **Singapore Green Mark** criteria, any refrigerant used should have:
- **ODP = 0**, and  
- **GWP < 100**.

Both R123 and R134a meet these standards.  

By contrast, older CFC refrigerants like **R12** and **R22** are not environmentally friendly ‚Äî  
they harm the ozone layer and have been **phased out**.

## üå± More Than Just Cooling

When engineers design an air-conditioning system, they don‚Äôt just pick a refrigerant at random.  
They consider multiple factors such as:

- Energy efficiency  
- Toxicity and safety  
- Atmospheric life (how long the gas lasts in the air)  
- Operating pressure  
- Cost and availability

## ‚öôÔ∏è The Four Main Components

The **vapour-compression air-conditioning cycle** ‚Äî used in most buildings ‚Äî relies on four major components working together:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Compressor** ‚Äì raises the pressure and temperature of the refrigerant.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Condenser** ‚Äì releases heat to the surroundings, turning vapour into liquid.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Expansion valve** ‚Äì drops the pressure and cools the liquid refrigerant.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Evaporator** ‚Äì absorbs heat from the indoor air, turning liquid back into vapour.  

These components are arranged in a **continuous loop**, circulating the refrigerant to repeat the process endlessly.

### üí° Summary

The next time you step into a cool building on a hot day, remember ‚Äî your comfort is powered by a clever dance of physics, chemistry, and engineering working quietly behind the scenes.
