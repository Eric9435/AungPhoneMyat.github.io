## Introduction

The **Sanitary Plumbing System** manages the **collection, conveyance, and disposal of wastewater** from plumbing fixtures in buildings.  
In Singapore, design and installation must conform to the **Code of Practice on Sewerage and Sanitary Works (COPSSW, 3rd Edition 2025)** issued by **PUB**.

A well-designed system ensures:
- Prevention of foul gas leakage.
- Self-cleansing velocity in pipes.
- Effective ventilation.
- Protection of water seals in traps.
- Ease of maintenance and accessibility.

## 1. Sanitary Drainage System Overview

### 1.1 System Purpose
To safely convey wastewater and soil discharge to the public sewer without:
- Leaks, odours, or health risks.
- Cross-contamination with potable water.

### 1.2 Types of Sanitary Systems
1. **Soil System** – from water closets, urinals, and bidets.  
2. **Waste System** – from basins, sinks, showers, floor traps.  
3. **Combined System** – when soil and waste discharge into common stacks.  
4. **Vent System** – maintains atmospheric pressure in pipes.

### 1.3 Typical Sanitary Stack Layout

## 2. Design Principles

| Design Element | Requirement | Reference |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| **Self-cleansing velocity** | ≥ 0.6 m/s for horizontal drains | COPSSW 2025 |
| **Gradient for 100 mm pipe** | 1:40 (2.5%) | COPSSW 2025 |
| **Minimum branch pipe size** | 50 mm (waste), 100 mm (soil) | COPSSW |
| **Water seal depth** | 50–75 mm | COPSSW |
| **Vent termination height** | ≥ 300 mm above roof level | COPSSW |
| **Stack venting** | One vent every 10 storeys | PUB requirement |

### 2.1 Flow Velocity Formula
```math
v = (Q / A)
```
Where:  
`v` = velocity (m/s)  
`Q` = discharge rate (L/s)  
`A` = cross-sectional area (m²)

### 2.2 Flow Capacity Formula (Manning’s Equation)
```math
Q = (1/n) × A × R^(2/3) × S^(1/2)
```
Where:  
`n` = roughness coefficient  
`R` = hydraulic radius  
`S` = slope of pipe

## 3. Sanitary System Components

### 3.1 Soil Stack
- Carries discharge from WCs, urinals, bidets.
- Min. diameter: 100 mm.
- Extend full bore to open air for venting.

### 3.2 Waste Stack
- For wash basins, sinks, baths, showers.
- Min. diameter: 50–75 mm.
- Requires trap at each fixture.

### 3.3 Traps
- Prevent sewer gas from entering occupied spaces.
- Must retain **minimum 50 mm water seal**.
- Common types: P-trap, S-trap, bottle trap, floor trap.

### 3.4 Floor Trap (FT)
- Receives discharge from multiple fixtures.
- Must have removable grating and cover.
- Connected via vented branch to soil stack.

### 3.5 Inspection Chambers (IC)
- Located at every change of direction or gradient.
- Max spacing: 30 m apart.
- Min internal dimension: 600 × 900 mm.

### 3.6 Manholes
- For main drain inspection.
- Depth > 1 m requires step irons or access ladder.

---

## 4. Ventilation of Drainage System

### 4.1 Purpose
- Prevent siphonage or back-pressure.
- Maintain trap water seals.
- Release foul gases safely above roof.

### 4.2 Vent System Types
1. **Main Vent Stack** – connected at head of soil stack.  
2. **Relief Vent** – between floors to equalize pressure.  
3. **Loop Vent** – between fixtures on same floor.  
4. **Anti-Siphon Trap Vent** – at individual traps.

### 4.3 Vent Pipe Design

| Pipe Diameter | Max No. of Floors Served | Min Height Above Roof |
|----------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| 50 mm | 3 | 300 mm |
| 75 mm | 6 | 300 mm |
| 100 mm | >6 | 600 mm |

---

## 5. Trade Waste and Grease Interception

### 5.1 Purpose
To intercept grease, oil, and solids before wastewater enters the sewer.

### 5.2 Grease Trap Design Formula
```math
V = Q × t
```
Where:  
`V` = volume (L)  
`Q` = flow rate (L/min)  
`t` = retention time (min) (typically 30–60 min)

### 5.3 Requirements
- Provide inlet/outlet baffles.  
- Install in accessible area for cleaning.  
- Minimum capacity: 1,000 L for commercial kitchens.  
- Cleaning frequency: weekly or as needed.

## 6. Materials and Jointing

| Material | Application | Standard |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| uPVC | Soil, waste, vent | SS 213 |
| Cast Iron (coated) | Stack or underground | SS 141 |
| HDPE | Underground / chemical effluent | ISO 4427 |
| Vitrified Clay | Sewer connection | SS 239 |
| Copper / Stainless Steel | Special applications | SS 375 |

### 6.1 Jointing
- uPVC: Solvent cement joint.  
- Cast Iron: Rubber ring or mechanical joint.  
- HDPE: Butt fusion or electrofusion joint.  
- Ensure water-tightness and flexibility.

---

## 7. Testing and Inspection

### 7.1 Water Test
- Fill vertical stack up to top of highest fixture.
- Maintain 1.5 m head for 30 min — **no leaks allowed**.

### 7.2 Air Test
- Apply air pressure = 38 mm water gauge for 15 min — **no drop allowed**.

### 7.3 Smoke Test
- Optional test to detect leaks or open joints.

### 7.4 Inspection Requirements
- PUB inspection mandatory before backfilling or concealment.  
- As-built drawings to be submitted post-completion.

## 8. Maintenance and Access

| Component | Maintenance Action | Frequency |
|------------|--------------------|------------|
| Traps | Check for water seal loss | Monthly |
| Floor Traps | Remove debris, clean grating | Monthly |
| Grease Trap | Remove grease/scum | Weekly |
| Inspection Chambers | Flush and inspect | 6-monthly |
| Roof Vents | Clear obstructions | Yearly |

Access fittings such as **cleanouts**, **rodding eyes**, and **manholes** must be provided at:
- Every 15 m for horizontal runs.
- Base of stacks.
- Changes in direction or junctions.

---

## 9. Sanitary Design Calculations

### 9.1 Discharge Unit (DU) System
COPSSW defines fixture loads as **Discharge Units (DU)**.  
Total DU determines pipe sizing.

| Fixture | Discharge Units (DU) |
|----------|----------------------|
| WC (flush valve) | 6 |
| WC (cistern) | 4 |
| Wash Basin | 1 |
| Bath Tub | 3 |
| Sink | 2 |
| Shower | 2 |
| Urinal | 2 |

**Formula for Probable Flow (Q):**
```math
Q = 0.018 × (DU)^0.8   (L/s)
```

### 9.2 Minimum Pipe Sizes

| Fixture / Branch | Diameter (mm) | Gradient |
|------------------|----------------|-----------|
| Wash Basin | 32–40 | 1:40 |
| Sink | 50 | 1:40 |
| WC | 100 | 1:60 |
| Soil Stack | 100 | Vertical |
| Waste Stack | 75 | Vertical |
| Branch Drain | 100 | 1:100 |
