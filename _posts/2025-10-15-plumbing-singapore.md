## 1. Water Supply System (SS 636)

### 1.1. Overview
Ensures the safe and adequate supply of potable water throughout a building. Governed by **SS 636:2018** and **PUB Water Service Works Regulations**.

### 1.2. Components

| Component | Design / Function | Key Code & Formula |
|------------|------------------|--------------------|
| **Incoming Water Main** | Connection from PUB mains with isolation valve and non-return valve. | Must meet PUB connection & approval. |
| **Storage Tanks** | Underground or rooftop; with access hatch, vent, overflow, and drain. | `V_total = V_domestic + V_fire + V_contingency` |
| **Pumps & Booster Sets** | Maintain pressure to upper floors. | `H_pump = H_static + H_friction + H_minor` |
| **Cold Water Distribution** | Network of pipes and valves. | `Q = A Ã— v`  <br> Typical velocity â‰¤ 2.0 m/s. |
| **Hot Water System** | Storage heaters, circulation loops, thermostatic control. | Insulate piping, temperature â‰¤ 60 Â°C. |
| **Backflow Prevention** | Double-check valves, air gaps, RPZ valves. | Minimum air gap â‰¥ 25 mm or 2Ã— pipe diameter. |
| **Water Meters** | Installed at main entry and sub-circuits. | Comply with PUB approved meter list. |

### 1.3. Common Formulae
- **Flow rate:**  
  `Q = A Ã— v`  
  where `Q = flow (mÂ³/s)`, `A = area (mÂ²)`, `v = velocity (m/s)`  
- **Head loss (Hazenâ€“Williams):**  
  `h_f = 10.67 Ã— L Ã— (Q^1.852) / (C^1.852 Ã— d^4.87)`  
- **Pump head:**  
  `H = H_static + H_friction + H_minor`

## 2. Sanitary & Sewerage Drainage (COPSSW)

### 2.1. Overview
Handles removal of wastewater and soil discharge safely. Governed by **PUB COPSSW (3rd Edition 2025)**.

### 2.2. Key Systems

| Subsystem | Description | Design Rule |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Soil Stack** | Vertical pipe for toilets and urinals. | Diameter 100 mm (min); vent every 10 storeys. |
| **Waste Stack** | For basins, sinks, showers. | Diameter 75 mm (typ.); use trap & vent. |
| **Vent Pipes** | Prevent trap siphonage. | Must terminate â‰¥ 300 mm above roof. |
| **Traps** | Maintain 50â€“75 mm water seal. | `Depth â‰¥ 50 mm` |
| **Branches** | Limit horizontal length before stack. | Max 2 m from trap to stack. |
| **Grease Trap** | Required for kitchens & F&B. | `V = Q Ã— t` (Retention 30â€“60 min). |
| **Inspection Chambers / Manholes** | Every 30 m or at direction changes. | Min 600 mm Ã— 900 mm. |

### 2.3. Testing
- **Water test:** 1.5 m head for 30 min (no leakage)  
- **Air test:** 38 mm water gauge for 15 min (no drop)

### 2.4. Materials
Approved materials include uPVC, HDPE, cast iron (coated), or vitrified clay â€” must comply with **SS 141**, **SS 213**, or **ISO 4427**.

## 3. Stormwater Drainage System

### 3.1. Overview
Designed to manage roof and surface runoff to prevent flooding and surcharge. Governed by **PUB Code of Practice on Surface Water Drainage**.

### 3.2. Design Components
- Roof gutters, downpipes  
- Ground drains, catch basins  
- Sump pits and storm pumps (if required)  
- Rainwater harvesting tanks (optional)  

### 3.3. Design Formula
**Rational Method:**  
`Q = C Ã— I Ã— A`  

Where:  
- `Q` = flow rate (mÂ³/s)  
- `C` = runoff coefficient  
- `I` = rainfall intensity (mm/hr)  
- `A` = catchment area (ha)

### 3.4. Typical Values
| Surface Type | Runoff Coefficient (C) |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Roof (impervious) | 0.9 |
| Concrete pavement | 0.8 |
| Grass / soil | 0.4â€“0.5 |

## 4. Fire Protection Water Systems

### 4.1. Overview
Plumbing interface with fire-fighting networks per **SCDF Fire Code**.

### 4.2. Components
| Item | Description |
|------|--------------|
| Fire Water Tank | 45 mÂ³ or as per fire demand. |
| Fire Pumps | Duty, standby & jockey pump. |
| Hydrants & Sprinklers | As per NFPA / SCDF layout. |
| Hose Reels | 30 m length, 19 mm hose diameter. |

### 4.3. Design
`Fire Demand = Flow Ã— Duration`  
E.g., `1,800 L/min Ã— 2 hours = 216 mÂ³` total.

## 5. Special Systems

### 5.1. Greywater Recycling
- Treats shower/basin discharge for reuse (WC flushing, irrigation).  
- Design retention: 6â€“8 hours in treatment tanks.  

### 5.2. Irrigation Systems
- Sprinkler / drip lines sized for 2.5â€“3 bar pressure.  
- Uniformity coefficient â‰¥ 85%.  

### 5.3. Swimming Pool Plumbing
- Turnover rate: 4â€“6 hours.  
- Filter design:  
  `Filter area = Flow rate / 10 (mÂ³/mÂ²Â·h)`

## 6. Inspection & Maintenance Checklist

| System | Inspection Items | Frequency |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| **Water Supply** | Tank cleaning, valve checks, leak test | 6 monthly |
| **Pumps** | Pressure & flow test, vibration, seal check | Monthly |
| **Sanitary Stack** | Trap seals, vent clearance, blockage | Quarterly |
| **Grease Trap** | Clean sludge & scum | Monthly |
| **Stormwater** | Gully cleaning, pump test | Quarterly |
| **Fire Pumps** | Flow test, auto start | Monthly |
| **Greywater Plant** | Water quality & disinfection | Monthly |

## 7. Design Calculation Guide

### 7.1. Pipe Sizing (Hazenâ€“Williams)
`h_f = 10.67 Ã— L Ã— (Q^1.852) / (C^1.852 Ã— d^4.87)`

Where:
- `h_f` = head loss (m)
- `L` = length (m)
- `Q` = flow (L/s)
- `C` = coefficient (e.g. 140 for copper)
- `d` = diameter (mm)

### 7.2. Pump Head Calculation
`H_total = H_static + H_friction + H_minor + Safety Margin`

### 7.3. Rainwater Flow
`Q = C Ã— I Ã— A`  
PUB Intensity Formula (Example):  
`I = 1000 Ã— [A / (t + B)^n]`  *(values A, B, n per rainfall zone)*

### 7.4. Sanitary Flow (Fixture Units)
Convert fixture units â†’ probable discharge:
| Fixture | FU | Typical Flow (L/s) |
|----------|----|--------------------|
| Water Closet | 4 | 2.5 |
| Basin | 1 | 0.15 |
| Shower | 2 | 0.2 |

Use tables in COPSSW for sizing stack & branch diameters.
