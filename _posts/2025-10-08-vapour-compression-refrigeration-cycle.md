We all know from experience that heat flows naturally from high-temperature to low-temperature spaces without requiring any devices.  
However, the reverse process of transferring heat from low-temperature conditioned spaces to the high-temperature outdoor ambient air requires a special device called the **Air-Conditioning and Mechanical Ventilation (ACMV)** system.  

The air-conditioning machines, commonly known as **chillers**, are cyclic devices.  
The working fluid used in the air-conditioning cycle is called a **refrigerant**.  

**R123** and **R134a** are two commonly used refrigerants in air-conditioning systems.  
Ozone Depletion Potentials (**ODP**) of R123 and R134a are 0.02 and 0, respectively.  
Global Warming Potentials (**GWP**) of R123 and R134a are **77** and **1430**, respectively.  

Based on **Singapore Green Mark** criteria:  
- ODP of refrigerant should be 0, and  
- GWP should be less than 100.  

Both R123 and R134a meet these environmental criteria.  
However, **CFC refrigerants** such as R12 and R22 are not environmentally friendly — they are being phased out and should not be used in air-conditioning systems.  

Manufacturers of air-conditioning systems also carefully consider other properties of refrigerants such as:  
- Efficiency  
- Toxicity  
- Atmospheric life  
- Operating pressure  
- Cost  

The most frequently used air-conditioning cycle is the **Vapour-Compression Air-Conditioning Cycle**, which consists of four main components:  
1. **Compressor**  
2. **Condenser**  
3. **Expansion Valve**  
4. **Evaporator**
